# Simple Algorithms in Ruby

These Ruby algorithms serve to find:
- 1_Power.rb - method power which takes two integers (base and exponent) and returns the base raised to the power of exponent.
- 2_Factorial.rb - takes a number and returns the product of every number up to the current number multiplied together.
- 3_Unique.rb - takes an array of items and returns the array without any duplicates
- 4_Combnations.rb - takes two arrays of strings and returns an array with all of the combinations of the items in them, listing the first items first.
- 5_Primes.rb - takes in a number and returns true if it is a prime number.
- 6_Rectangle_Overlap - takes two rectangles defined by the coordinates of their corners, e.g. [[0,0],[3,3]] and [[1,1],[4,6]], and determines whether they overlap. You can assume all coordinates are positive integers.
- The_Counter_Game.rb - 10 friends are sitting in a circle around a table and decide to play a new game. In it, they count up through the numbers from 1 to 100. The first person says "1", the second says "2" and so on... but with a few catches:

Whenever the number is divisible by 7, they switch directions. So person 6 will say "6", person 7 will say "7", then person 6 again will say "8".
Whenever the number is divisible by 11, they skip the next person for the following number. For instance, if person 3 says "33", person 5 will say "34" instead (person 4 gets skipped).


## Getting Started

If you want to quick run some examples to see the code in action run
```
$ ruby example.rb
```
from the project directory.
